# Multilingual Online Translator

A console-based translator.

Run it from the command line using ``python translator.py [source language] [target language] [word to translate]`` (without brackets). At this time, the translator only accepts single words. It does not yet accept phrases or sentences.

Supported languages include, in alphabetical order:
* Arabic
* Dutch
* English
* French
* German
* Hebrew
* Japanese
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Romanian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Turkish

You can also translate to all of the above languages simultaneously by setting the target language to ``all``.

If you're on Windows, you can try it out for yourself by downloading ``translator.zip`` [here](https://github.com/jasonalantolbert/Multilingual-Online-Translator/releases/). Extract the archive to a folder of your choice, then run the ``setup.cmd`` file inside before running ``translator.py``. macOS and Linux users will need to extract ``translator.zip`` and manually run ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` inside the folder.
